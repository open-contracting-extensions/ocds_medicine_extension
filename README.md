# Medicine extension

Add fields to the tender and award drug items to describe the medicine attributes, such as active ingredient, dosage, container, route of administration, brand, manufacturer, etc.

## Background

With the objective of developing a medicine extension, a study was carried out on the way in which drug purchase data is currently published in different countries, the use that users make of it, and the standards of medicines, substances and drugs that exist.

The study included interviews with 6 publishers and 4 users who relate to drug purchases in different ways such as: system maintenance, people who write the terms of reference for medicine purchases, data analysts, medicime price analyst, software developers for medicine purchase systems, advocacy and accountability groups, journalists

The most common questions related to medicine prices were:

<ul>
<li>Q1: How do we know if two products are comparable?</li>
<li>Q2: Is it possible to make price comparisons between different medicine vendors?</li>
<li>Q3: Are the products on the price reference list?</li>
<li>Q4: How much and at what price was it purchased and from whom?</li>
<li>Q5: Is there a noticeable difference between the market and awarded prices?</li>
<li>Q6: What is the average price of the public market in the last X months?</li>
<li>Q7: Who are the bidders and what are the purchase conditions?</li>
<li>Q8: Who was it bought from?</li>
<li>Q9: Who buys?</li>
<li>Q10: What is the relationship between suppliers, shareholders, laboratories and political finance?</li>
<li>Q11: What is the evolution of prices over time?</li>
<li>Q12: What is the manufacturer's quality, delivery time, and contract performance guarantee?</li>
<li>Q13: How much does what was spent on this input represent against the entity's budget?</li>
</ul>

The analysis resulted in this extension.
